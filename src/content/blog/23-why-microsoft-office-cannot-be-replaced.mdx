Why Microsoft Office Cannot Be Replaced

As much as I support free and open-source software, there are some applications such as those of the Microsoft Office suite that cannot be entirely replaced. Microsoft Office holds critical places in our lives, including in personal use, education models, business systems, and government operations!

Despite the competition of well-made FOSS alternatives, like LibreOffice which was used to draft this article, Microsoft Office is unlikely to be dethroned as the king of all office suites. Here is my evaluation of why Microsoft Office will continue to be chosen by the vast majority of people as their office suite of choice!

The Rise To Power

Once upon a time in the 1990s, there was a battle for domination in the office suite space. Organizations were still figuring out how to set up their systems, and various competitors offered different options for productivity. Microsoft Office had to compete against other big office suites, notably those from Lotus and WordPerfect!

In those early years, Microsoft Office was forced to innovate constantly by developing new features and improving the user experience. The development of the three core applications of its office suite - Word, PowerPoint, and Excel - propelled Microsoft into the lead! Eventually, Microsoft Office became the de facto standard for office suites with all major organizations adopting its use.

Microsoft has continued to this day with a generally unchallenged position as the ultimate office suite. Nowadays, companies often specifically include in their job requirements that candidates should be familiar with Microsoft Office!

Since the battle of the office suites, an entire generation of people has grown up essentially knowing no other alternatives!

FOSS Competitors Emerging

One of the main aims of the FOSS community is to provide viable alternatives to the most popular proprietary applications. Based on this aim, we have LibreOffice available to us as a functional alternative to Microsoft Office!

LibreOffice is an office suite that includes programs for word-processing, slideshows, spreadsheets, databases, equations, and drawings. LibreOffice focuses on providing an office suite with similar features to the popular applications in Microsoft Office!

LibreOffice uses the OpenDocument format by default but also supports a wide range of formats including the proprietary ones used by Microsoft Office.

LibreOffice Online is a web-based version of LibreOffice intended for convenience and collaboration. However, it is best implemented by companies such as Collabora that provide cloud hosting as well as technical support. Collabora runs on a commercial business model by providing an office suite based on LibreOffice.

LibreOffice is developed by The Document Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting open-source software.

Some other notable FOSS competitors include OnlyOffice and OpenOffice.

Trying To Switch

Open-source office suites are becoming increasingly popular among individuals, organizations, and governments! Making the switch to an option such as LibreOffice comes with many advantages but also notable shortcomings.

The LibreOffice suite is installed by default on many popular Linux operating systems and is also straightforward to install via downloads! This ease with which one can start using LibreOffice is what makes it particularly popular in the open-source community.

Individuals often choose open-source office suites due to the cost barrier of proprietary options like Microsoft Office. LibreOffice is a superb alternative for students seeking a desktop office suite that provides all the essential components of Microsoft Office at no cost!

In many cases though, education institutions’ partnerships with Microsoft make using their office suite compulsory and thus, alternatives like LibreOffice are not suitable.

In the cases of businesses, open-source office suites relieve the significant burden of licensing fees that would need to be paid for the proprietary office suite of Microsoft Office. The lack of this expense can be especially significant for companies that are just starting up as well as non-profit organizations.

However, the frequency of updates to implement features and fix bugs is significantly lower with open-source projects compared to the capability of a giant like Microsoft.

To make matters worse, technical support is comparatively weaker for open-source alternatives. The Document Foundation itself does not provide technical support at all. Meanwhile, companies such as Collabora attempt to make LibreOffice a solid commercial option by offering that much-needed support.

The vast majority of businesses use Microsoft Office as the standard, which may pose issues when organizations and individuals must work together. These issues may include workers having to switch between office suites as well as the cross-suite compatibility of documents where formatting is especially important.

Many governments, particularly in Europe, are making the switch to open-source software. LibreOffice is popular among government bodies ranging from cities to ministries to entire regions. The greatest benefits of making this switch include technological sovereignty from proprietary software and cost savings from not having to pay licensing fees.

In 2013, the administration of the Spanish autonomous region of Valencia completed its migration of 120,000 computers to LibreOffice including schools and courts.

In 2015, the Italian Ministry of Defense announced that it would trust LibreOffice as their office suite of choice on 150,000 computers leading to savings estimated to range from €26,000,000-€29,000,000.

In 2020, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein announced it would switch completely from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice by 2025 on 25,000 computers.

Some other big cities using LibreOffice include Toulouse, France; Barcelona, Spain; and Rome, Italy.

However, the switch to LibreOffice has not been positive all around. The city of Munich, Germany, actually switched back to Microsoft Office after switching to LibreOffice a few years earlier. Workers complained about compatibility issues and difficulty transitioning into the LibreOffice ecosystem.

Beyond Europe, the option of making the switch to LibreOffice gains little to no attention. Especially in Microsoft’s home country of the United States, the company has cemented its reputation as an essential for all office systems.

The Road Ahead

The fate of The Document Foundation is unknown. Given that it is a non-profit organization offering a free product, it relies in donations from other organizations. This structure results in a funding problem that makes operations in the long-term and even at times in the short-term quite shaky.

Furthermore, the actual development of LibreOffice is done by only a few paid developers and is largely progressed by the volunteer contributions of the open-source community. This slow and unreliable rate of development makes innovation and even regular maintenance a challenge.

A conversion to a commercial business model in an attempt to solve the funding would violate The Document Foundation’s mission of improving accessibility to software. Any price placed on LibreOffice would exclude some users and disincentivize others from choosing LibreOffice over Microsoft Office.

Although separate companies with a commercial business model like Collabora try to address many of these problems, they still rely on The Document Foundation’s LibreOffice since it is upstream to their products.

By contrast, Microsoft maintains a solid future for its office suite and continues to benefit from the massive scale of its company. Microsoft has vast resources in infrastructure and workers. The company when looking at its office suite alone is growing steadily thanks to revenue from Microsoft Office licensing fees that must be renewed as well as new contracts being made with various organizations.

The company even continues to innovate by adding new features, improving the user layout, and bringing bug fixes as well as security updates to new versions. Now, Microsoft Office even has a web-based office suite that allows for online editing and collaboration.

All in all, Microsoft Office is here to stay. Microsoft Office has such as strong hold on individuals, education institutions, businesses, and governments that any shifts in the market beyond a few organizations are unlikely to occur. People and organizations have grown all too close with Microsoft Office as it has served them well for decades.

Although we see switches in European governments, they may not persist as workers must adapt to a new office suite. Furthermore, switches in government systems are adoptions of a new office suite in internal systems as opposed to the business world where systems across many organizations must be compatible with each other. In any case, the sustainability of LibreOffice is questionable as The Document Foundation may not be able to continue operating effectively in the years to come.
