A Whole World of FOSS on Android

So you want to explore FOSS software but are not sure where to start? Installing new apps on your Android phone is one of the easiest ways to try out FOSS alternatives to mainstream software! However, if you go looking for many FOSS apps on default app stores, such as the Google Play Store, you may not be able to find them. Fortunately, there’s a whole other world of apps that you can access through an app store called F-Droid, which is exclusively dedicated to FOSS! Here’s how you can use F-Droid and get started using FOSS on android!

You will need to download the .apk file for installation directly from the F-Droid website since Google Play Store and other app stores do not allow competing apps to be made available through their platform. See the link below for the official website, the only source from which you should download their .apk file.

https://f-droid.org/

For experienced users, a PGP signature is also available to verify the download.

Once the .apk file is downloaded, just open the file and allow its installation! After the installation is complete, open your settings and under the “Install unknown apps” permission, toggle “Allow from this source” for F-Droid. This setting will allow you to easily install apps from F-Droid just like you would from default app stores. Now, simply open F-Droid, and explore!

The F-Droid interface is excellent in terms of user-experience as it provides quite intuitive navigation. The homepage displays a series of recommended apps. If you are looking for a specific app, you can search for it with ease!

You can also browse apps by category!

F-Droid provides a “Nearby” feature which allows you to get apps from people near you rather than downloading them from the Internet. This feature is great for use among family and friends as well as for those without Internet! However, not all users may be comfortable allowing their device to be used by others.

Updating apps is also very intuitive, and just like other app stores, you can receive notifications when updates are available. The only drawback is you must allow installation for each individual app as opposed to queuing a series of apps to be installed in succession.

You can customize F-Droid using the variety of settings available. If there is a specific FOSS app or series of apps you wish to install through F-Droid but is not available by default, you can also add Repositories. Here, I have enabled all four default repositories, and I have also added the “Bromite official F-Droid repository” for the Bromite browser.

A specific app listing provides nearly all the information you need! Some notable points include the name of the app, name of the developer, period of last update, images, links, permissions and versions. However, F-Droid does not include user ratings and comments as available on other app stores such as Google Play Store.

In all, F-Droid is an amazing gateway into FOSS on Android and a must-have for all software enthusiasts! Many apps that we will be looking at on The FOSS Albatross are available on F-Droid, so we highly recommend installing it whether you are already well into the FOSS world or just getting started!
