Top 5 Linux Operating Systems For Beginners

The world of Linux can be very daunting for beginners given the vast number of operating system choices. You are finally realizing that the world of operating systems extends far beyond just Windows and macOS thanks to free and open-source alternatives. Choosing your first Linux operating system can be a challenge, but fortunately you can now stop looking! Having made the switch to Linux myself and with experience in a plethora of different operating systems, here are my top 5 recommendations for beginners!

Ubuntu

Ubuntu is undoubtedly my number one choice for beginners. Ubuntu is well-known and well-respected for its steady development. A wide variety of apps run on Ubuntu, meaning compatibility is less of an issue for users transitioning to Linux for the first time. Ubuntu is also one of the most widely used Linux operating systems, meaning beginners can easily find guides and other resources online for help.

Ubuntuâ€™s default desktop environment is GNOME, which provides a rather unique user experience compared to Windows or macOS. However, it gives users the opportunity to become acquainted with the whole new world of Linux while offering some while not overwhelming room to customize.

Ubuntu also has many flavours that may be best suited to specific users. Choose from different desktop environments such as MATE and KDE. Perhaps even try Ubuntu Studio for an operating system designed for content creators or Lubuntu for a lightweight experience.

Linux Mint

Linux Mint is my current daily driver and my recommendation for users seeking a smooth transition from Windows. Linux Mint is great out-of-the-box with many apps pre-installed and the Cinnamon desktop environment by default. Cinnamon is specially designed to help users transition from Windows to Linux with an interface that is as intuitive as possible for that target audience. The interface can be easily customized as well.

Since Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, app compatibility is essentially identical. Also, Linux Mint has a big community around it, so finding support online is easy.

Pop!\_OS

Pop!\_OS is an operating system similar to Ubuntu but great-looking out-of-the-box. Pop!\_OS has been gaining popularity lately since it provides a more attractive experience for users looking to try something new aside from the standard look of Windows or macOS. Pop!\_OS ships with a customized setup of GNOME that is more intuitive for beginners.

Once again, Pop!\_OS is based on Ubuntu, thus reaping the benefits of good app compatibility and a big community online. Furthermore, Pop!\_OS was recently chosen by HP as the default operating system for its shiny new Dev One laptop!

elementary OS

elementary OS is my recommendation for users looking to transition from macOS to Linux. elementary OS definitely has the prettiest interface out-of-the-box that embodies the minimalist design of macOS. elementary OS also comes with many unique applications pre-installed that will help with your productivity.

elementary OS may not have as strong of a community as the other operating systems on this list, but it is certainly still a good choice especially for beginners who value a clean aesthetic. After all, elementary OS is also based on Ubuntu, so app compatibility and support are pretty good.

Fedora

Fedora is a fantastic option if you would like to try something other than Ubuntu. While Fedora may look the same as Ubuntu out-of-the-box since they both use GNOME by default, Fedora is quite different under-the-hood. There are many differences including the installer, package management, and operation; however, in the case of beginners, these differences are stories for future articles. Fedora is arguably just as well-supported as Ubuntu, meaning it also has good app compatibility and help online.

For beginners, simply select the operating system that looks good to you, or perhaps one that your friends are already using! Since beginners are going to spend more time getting used to Linux rather than customizing it to their needs, an appealing setup out-of-the-box is ideal. Click the links above to learn more about each operating system on their respective pages. Have fun exploring Linux!
