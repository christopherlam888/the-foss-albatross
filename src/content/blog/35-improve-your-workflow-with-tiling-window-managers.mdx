Improve Your Workflow With Tiling Window Managers

Point. Click! A new window appears in the middle of your screen!

This might be exactly what you want, that is the application you need being placed right in front of you. However, consider another situation.

Point. Click! A new window appears in the middle of your screen, but blocking the window you already have open and still need to see!

Let’s say you’re researching a big report and need to reference statistics from an article. Wouldn’t having two windows side by side – one with your writer and one with your browser – be helpful? Instead, you’ve got your writer on top of your browser, and now you have to take extra steps to get your desktop organized!

You can either drag the windows to the sides of your screen if you have window snapping, or you have to manually resize each window. These extra steps are a pain to perform every time you open more than one window! Fortunately, you can set up your desktop so you don’t have to worry about resizing your windows. Enter the exciting world of tiling window managers!

What’s a tiling window manager?

A window manager, as the name suggests, is the software that controls the behaviour of your windows. However, a window manager can help you do so much more to customize your desktop, such as allowing you to configure keybindings, bars, and menus!

You’re probably used to working with a floating window manager, which allows your windows to appear anywhere on the screen whether they’re side-by-side or overlapping. The big issue with floating window managers is you have to interact with the windows to arrange them how you want. You’ll have to move your mouse to drag the windows to their positions, change their sizes, minimize them, and close them.

By contrast, a tiling window manager automatically organizes your windows when you open them. You can have your windows stack horizontally or vertically, tab, spiral, or even arrange themselves in a custom layout of your choice!

Perhaps the greatest benefit of tiling window managers is you can become significantly less reliant on your mouse – in fact, you don’t have to use your mouse at all if you don’t want to!

Want to open your browser? No need to point! Press your favourite key combination (like mod+w), and a new window appears automatically in full screen! Want to open your writer? Open your menu with another of your favourite key combinations (like $mod+d), type the package name of your writer, and press Enter. Not only does a new window open, but it opens right where you want it, say to the right of your existing window with both windows resized to half-screen!

What tiling window manager should I use?

There are many different tiling window managers each with their own benefits and shortcomings. These window managers also have different setups out of the box as well as customization processes and options. Additionally, tiling window managers vary in what languages you can use to write the configurations as well as in levels of development and support. You’ll need to try them out to get a feel for what tiling window managers are like!

A few popular tiling window managers are I3, BSPWM, Awesome, Qtile, and Xmonad!

My tiling window manager of choice is Sway, which is based on I3 and the only well-developed tiling manager with Wayland support! Stay tuned on The FOSS Albatross to learn more about Linux display servers.

How can I get started?

The easiest way to get started with a tiling window manager is to install a Linux distro with one set up out of the box! This path is great for beginner Linux users who just want a taste of the tiling window manager workflow.

I recommend EndeavourOS for Linux users who are ready for this next stage of the Linux exploration process! EndeavourOS is an Arch Linux-based distro that comes with many different desktop environments and window managers from which you can choose at installation. I3 is officially supported, and you can explore the community editions that include Sway, Qtile, BSPWM, OpenBox, and the EndeavourOS exclusive Worm.

If you’re looking to set up your own configuration from the vanilla version of your window manager of choice, you can always install it on your favourite Linux distro. Currently, I’m using my custom config of Sway on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS!

Takeaways

Since I set up my tiling window manager desktop, I’ve been using it more and more over the floating window set up in Linux Mint’s Cinnamon. The speed and ease with which I can organize and navigate my desktop makes me wonder why it took me so many years before trying out a tiling window manager! Plus, my minimalist setup keeps me free from distractions and focused on my work.

If you really want to speed up your workflow and have fun customizing your unique config in the process, then a tiling window manager is for you!
