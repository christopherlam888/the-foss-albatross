You Need This On Your Phone Now! A Guide To 2FA With TOTP

You’ve probably heard of 2FA in the cybersecurity community or even on the news as an important step in protecting your accounts. All the time, people and companies fall victim to various hacks that could have been prevented if only they had 2FA enabled. But what is 2FA, and why is it so important that you set it up right now?

Intro to 2FA

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) refers to any second method, in addition to your regular password, through which you must prove your access to an account in order to log in. The effectiveness of 2FA lies in the principle that hackers are less likely to compromise your password and your method of 2FA to gain access to your account. Essentially, even if hackers can crack your password as “password123”, they still have to somehow gain access to your phone to get the 2FA code that is available through whatever method you set up.

TOTP Among Other 2FA Methods

Common 2FA methods include SMS, call, email, and TOTP. In the cases of SMS, call, and email 2FA, you are sent a code that you must input to a login portal for your account. However, the potential security risk lies in the sending of the code, which is particularly susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks since SMS, call, and email are generally not end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, SMS and call 2FA are vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks, which are when hackers impersonate you to assign your mobile details to a new SIM in their possession.

Meanwhile, TOTP is a method of generating authentication codes independently. TOTP is local, so it functions without network access, and it does not rely on any other service or protocol that may be compromised. TOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Password. In a nutshell, a TOTP app on your phone can generate a unique code for authentication that is regenerated at regular time intervals.

The TOTP Process

1. A service provides a unique key for your account in the form of a QR code or a string of characters.

2. You store that unique key in a TOTP app. Now you and the service have a copy of this unique key.

3. The TOTP app combines the unique key and the current time rounded to a certain time interval (such as the nearest 30 seconds) to generate an authentication code.

4. You input this authentication code to the service login portal. If this authentication code matches the code generated by the service using the same process, you are granted access.

5. The authentication code changes at regular time intervals (such as every 30 seconds) to prevent brute force attacks.

Once again, the beauty of TOTP is that it can function entirely locally, so you do not have to worry about your 2FA authentication code being intercepted via the Internet or any other service or protocol. However, do note that some TOTP apps do require network access or rely on other services such as Google Play Services, so be sure to avoid these to minimize your attack surface.

Note that TOTP while providing an added layer of security is not perfect. You will still be vulnerable to phishing attacks that trick you into entering your authentication code and then use that authentication code within the time interval it remains valid. However, having TOTP is still far better than being without this layer of security.

Which Accounts Support TOTP?

So you’ve been convinced to use TOTP! But do the accounts you use even support 2FA? Of course, you want to know if you can use TOTP to protect sensitive areas of your life such as banking, communication, and ecommerce. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to find out!

Check out the free and open-source project 2FA Directory! This handy website is based on crowdsourced reports that list popular services in various countries and what types of 2FA they support. Simply search up your service of choice to see whether it has TOTP. Alternatively, you can browse services in your country by category to select one that supports TOTP.

Start Using A TOTP App Now!

Since TOTP is an open standard, it can be easily adopted by services that wish to implement it as part of their login security and developers who wish to create their own TOTP apps. There are many apps you can use to house your 2FA codes, but some provide better features and interfaces than others.

My TOTP app of choice is Aegis, a FOSS option that is easy to use and offers many advantages over popular options like Authy, Duo Mobile, and Microsoft Authenticator!

The most important feature of Aegis is the ease with which you can create backups of your TOTP keys! The data can be exported to an encrypted file that can be later imported to restore TOTP functionality. This feature is great if you want to switch to a separate device or easily recover your previous setup should your existing device be stolen!

Meanwhile, Authy, Duo Mobile, and Microsoft Authenticator will not allow you to create proper backups of your TOTP keys once you set up your accounts. You will either be forced to stay in their closed-source app ecosystem via their proprietary backup system or repeat the process of setting up TOTP with each and every one of your accounts!

For example, Duo Mobile only allows backups through Duo Restore, which does not work across different operating systems or different authentication apps. To make matters worse, Duo Restore requires that you set up your backups through Google Drive rather than locally.

Furthermore, Aegis allows you to encrypt the vault storing your TOTP keys using a password or biometrics (fingerprint, face identity). This feature adds another layer of security to this especially sensitive data on your phone.

What are you waiting for? Go get set up with that crucial layer of security for your accounts!
