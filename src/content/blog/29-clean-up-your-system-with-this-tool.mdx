Clean Up Your System With This Tool

You can save potentially gigabytes of space on your computer by running BleachBit! With just a click of a button, you can delete files you don’t need and probably don’t even know exist. Here is how it’s done!

Set Up BleachBit

BleachBit [https://www.bleachbit.org/] is a FOSS tool you can download and install for Windows or Linux. Simply run the installer, and you can get started!

BleachBit’s user interface is quite simple and intuitive! The different areas you can clean are organized on the left, including system and applications. From there, you can check which areas and specific categories you would like to clean.

For some particularly important areas such as those including passwords saved in-browser or desktop shortcuts, you will receive a helpful warning upon selection!

Clean!

Once you have selected all you would like to clean, you can simply press the “Clean” button to begin the process!

But before you begin, you can see which files will be deleted, the disk space to be recovered, the number of files to be deleted, and the number of operations to be completed by pressing the “Preview” button.

That’s it! With BleachBit, cleaning your system is really as easy as clicking a button.

Running BleachBit for the first time can be very rewarding. The first time I ran BleachBit, which was on a Windows computer, I was able to clear out several gigabytes of space! Now, I run BleachBit on a regular basis to keep my system free of unneeded files.

Shred!

BleachBit also comes with a shred feature, which is very important for deleting sensitive files such as legal contracts, financial information, and confidential workplace documents.

In many cases, the default method for deleting files does not really delete the data of your file. Instead, you computer makes the sectors where your file is stored inaccessible and marks those sectors as available to be overwritten with new data. File recovery tools and experts can still recover such files that are not truly deleted!

BleachBit’s shred function can be used on a file or a folder. Shredding a file overwrites the entirety of the sectors where the file is stored with blank data. With this method, the contents of the file you shred cannot be recovered.

BleachBit is an amazing tool that belongs on every system! I highly recommend trying its features.
