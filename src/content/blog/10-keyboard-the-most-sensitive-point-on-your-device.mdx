Keyboard: The Most Sensitive Point of Your Device

When most people think about privacy and security online, they usually focus on the apps they use and webpages they visit. Yet, most people forget about the most sensitive part, which is the keyboard!

Your keyboard tracks everything you do online through the characters you type, including your name, email, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, search queries, and all other personal data! Unfortunately, this point on your device can be compromised by entities wishing to gather as much of your data as possible for their own gain.

Problems With Mobile Device Keyboards

The most common concern with keyboards on mobile devices is that the apps may be granted Internet access. If a keyboard application is granted Internet access, it can send logs of user typing to companies that may then use it for various purposes. Personal identifiers such as your name, email, usernames, and phone numbers may be stored and sold to marketers. General information such as commonly typed words and search queries can also be used for marketing through training algorithms for keyboard suggestions and targeted advertising.

Here are some common mobile device keyboards that have network access:

- Gboard

- Microsoft Swiftkey

- Ai.type

- Grammarly – Grammar Keyboard

The invasion of privacy becomes an even greater concern as these companies often handle your data irresponsibly. This extremely sensitive data about you and your activity online may not be stored securely and thus leaked to potentially malicious actors. This claim is not suspicion but fact given that two popular keyboards, Microsoft Swiftkey and Ai.type, have already had data leaks. Microsoft Swiftkey had a bug that suggested personal email addresses to random users. Ai.type had its database of over 31 million users’ names, emails, phone numbers, and typing activity exposed in a database online.

Which Keyboards To Use

The best solution to keeping your typing activity private is by choosing a keyboard that does not send your data off your device. This way, you do not need to trust another entity with safeguarding your data.

Fortunately, there are many FOSS keyboard alternatives! FOSS keyboards are great because the code can publicly checked for any excessive collection of data that could be considered an invasion of privacy. As such, FOSS applications in general do not include excessive trackers, permissions, or functions. Most FOSS keyboards do not require network access.

My keyboard of choice is AnySoftKeyboard, which can be easily downloaded from the Google Play Store and F-Droid. AnySoftKeyboard is a highly customizable keyboard that you can adapt to your typing needs. You can change the language, UI, and gestures in its extensive settings menu.

You can even make the keyboard change colour theme depending on which app you use!

Additionally, AnySoftKeyboard has an easy-to-use set up process that helps you set it as your default keyboard.

Other FOSS keyboards include Simple Keyboard, OpenBoard, and FlorisBoard.

My main issue with FOSS mobile keyboards is that most Asian languages are not supported. As such, I still need to switch to a different keyboard for typing in Chinese.

Thus, one solution that allows you to continue using your original keyboard is disabling its network access. You can use an application like NetGuard on Google Play Store or F-Droid to block network access for individual apps. Stay tuned to The FOSS Albatross to learn more about FOSS software to help you manage permissions!
