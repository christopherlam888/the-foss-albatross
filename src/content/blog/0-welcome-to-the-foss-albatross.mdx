Welcome to The FOSS Albatross

Welcome to The FOSS Albatross, a blog focused on building exposure around free and open-source software!

We are a team of young technology-minded students who have experience using a multitude of FOSS options and have been using FOSS in-place of many dominant alternatives for several years.

The FOSS Albatross aims to educate everyday people about software that they may not hear about in mainstream sources as well as provide tips and tricks that may help improve their lives! Just like the incredible wingspan of the albatross, our blog aims to cover a wide-variety of topics ranging from Linux operating systems to mobile chat platforms!

Moreover, our blog aims to foster deep and detailed discussions on the benefits and potential shortcomings of such software. All in all, we would like you to learn about a corner of technology that is unfortunately mostly kept in the dark.

We hope you grow to appreciate the breadth and depth of FOSS offerings just as we have throughout our journey in technology!
