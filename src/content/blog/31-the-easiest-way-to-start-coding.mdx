The Easiest Way to Start Coding!

You want to start leaning how to code! But as you begin getting set up, you become very confused about IDEs, compilers, interpreters, and all the other software you must install!

Fear not, for there is an easy way for beginners to start coding right away without having to worry about building a local environment. In this article, we will explore how online tools like Judge0 IDE let you forget about the set up and jump straight into writing code!

How Do You Run Code?

Code that you write in a given language must be translated into code that is understandable by your computer and thus can be executed! The process of translating code is done by a compiler, an interpreter, or an assembler.

A compiler converts code from a source language to a target language. A compiler first generates a .obj file intermediate and then an executable that can be run by a computer.

An interpreter also converts code from a source language to a target language. However, while a compiler converts the entire code and then runs, an interpreter converts and runs the code line-by-line.

Different programming languages are compiled or interpreted. Some examples of compiled languages are C, C++, and Go. Some examples of interpreted languages are Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

An assembler is required for executing code written in assembly languages.

In order to run code on your computer, you need to have the proper compiler, interpreter, or assembler installed such that your local environment is properly set up! Also, note that some languages like Java require installing a complete local environment.

Plus, you of course want a nice interface in which to work! You will need to install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VSCode or Atom where you can write or run your code.

All this can be great barrier to entry for beginners who just want to get a taste of what it’s like to code!

Online Compilers/Interpreters/Assemblers

Online compilers/interpreters/assemblers solve the problem of having to set up your own local environment!

Many websites offer the service of running your code in their environments. These services have computers that are already set up to run programming languages.

So, all you need to do is input your code into the website of an online compiler/interpreter/assembler service. They will execute the code on their computers and show you the result. Everything is done by sending the data over the Internet, hence the term “online”!

Get Started With This FOSS Solution!

Judge0 IDE [https://ide.judge0.com/] is a fantastic FOSS option to start coding online!

Judge0 IDE offers a wide variety of languages with different compilers/interpreters from which you can choose.

Judge0 IDE, as the name suggests, also offers an IDE with many features to help you code.

Simply select which language and compiler/interpreter you would like to use, start coding in the space provided, and press the “Run” button for online execution!

You can see your output below and provide input if necessary.

Every time you are finished coding, you can easily download your file to save or share!

Judge0 IDE is really a great way for beginners to start coding and even for experienced developers to try new languages!

I often use this solution to learn new programming languages or sometimes just to run code on a computer that does not have the right environment set up!
