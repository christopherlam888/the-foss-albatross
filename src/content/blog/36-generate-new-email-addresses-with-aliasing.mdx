Generate New Email Addresses With Aliasing

Ever need an email just to sign up for promotions or make a new account? With email aliases, you can create as many new email addresses as you need!

Email aliasing services like SimpleLogin and AnonAddy receive emails for you using an email address you create, and then they forward your emails to your real email address. This setup opens up a world of new possibilities to make managing your email easier!

Here are four reasons why you need to start using email aliases!

Take Back Control from Marketing!

We’re all familiar with the agony of trying to unsubscribe after being bombarded with way too many emails telling us to check out the latest sale! But if you sign up with an email alias, all you need to do is delete the email address you used!

What’s even more powerful is you can block emails coming from a specific sender. Let’s say you want to receive email notifications from Amazon, but you don’t want to know about Amazon’s business deals. Well, you can block the email address for Amazon Business!

Keep Organized

With everything becoming increasingly done online, we have more accounts than ever to manage! Using email aliases, you can create different emails for different parts of your life. Use one email address for social media, another for shopping, and yet another for finance. This strategy helps you organize your mailbox and comes with many privacy benefits as well!

Privacy

Of course, email aliases give you the convenience of not needing to give your real email for anything! This means the companies that ask for your email have one less data point to identify you. If you categorize your activities into different aliases, then data companies won’t know that you, the dog-lover on Instagram, also eats at McDonald’s, studies with Khan Academy, and trades stocks with Wealthsimple! This technique to track you over multiples services using a unique data point is cross-platform tracking.

Your email address is like your home address but for the Internet. You’re careful when telling people where you live because then they can stalk you, attempt to rob you, and impersonate you. The same can be done with your email address but with cross-platform tracking, phishing and social engineering!

Track Down and Stop Spam

No one likes being the target of phishing and spam attacks. But ever wonder how an attacker got your email in the first place? By keeping track of which email alias you use for which service, you can figure out which service compromised your email address to the attacker who sent you that bad email!

From there, you can delete the email alias that forwarded that bad email and no longer worry about that source of spam! If you want to take a step further, you can reach out to the service with which you trusted your email address and inquire as to what happened to your data.

So next time your sign up for a new service, don’t give out your real email and use an alias instead! SimpleLogin and AnonAddy are both great services you can try for free. Both services are open source and privacy-respecting. Of course, you do need to trust them with your real email address though; otherwise, how would they forward you your emails?
