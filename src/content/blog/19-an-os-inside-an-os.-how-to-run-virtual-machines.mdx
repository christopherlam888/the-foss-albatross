An OS Inside An OS! How To Run Virtual Machines

Using virtual machines is a great way to explore technology in the scope of both hardware and software. Especially for users keen on trying free and open-source software, such as Linux operating systems and system applications, virtual machines provide a convenient playground.

With virtual machines, you can run a fully-functioning Linux operating system within your primary Windows operating system - like a set Russian nesting dolls! Here is how you can run virtual machines with a free and open source application called VirtualBox.

What Is Virtualization?

Virtualization is a method of more efficiently using a single computer’s hardware resources such that it functions like multiple computers. In essence, you can allocate part of your computer’s processing power, RAM, storage, and other resources to run a separate operating system within the computer’s main operating system. Each of these separate operating systems runs in a virtual machine (VM).

The technique of virtualization is commonly used in IT and cloud computing to more efficiently manage company resources. After all, why not take advantage of the full potential of your hardware?

The Conveniences of Virtual Machines

The main benefit of virtual machines is being able to tap into resources that you might not otherwise use! You can use these resources to improve your productivity or simply add conveniences to your life with tech. For example, isn’t it a waste if your computer has 16 GB of RAM but you only ever use 8 GB? Why not take advantage of that remaining 8 GB to do something cool? Keep reading until the end to learn about some neat uses for virtual machines!

Furthermore, virtual machines are designed to function in an isolated environment. Thus, anything you do in the operating system of your virtual machine will not ruin important files or software that you keep on your primary set up! IT professionals often use virtual machines as a sandbox for activities that could potentially lead to harm on their systems.

Getting Started With VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free and open-source application created by Oracle that lets you easily create, manage, and run virtual machines! Check out the website here to download the installer for your operating system.

Creating a new virtual machine is easy! Simply follow the prompts that guide you through set up. You can name your virtual machine as well as select a type and operating system version to let VirtualBox automatically provide a good default configuration. You can then specify the RAM and storage space you want to allocate. There is a wide array of other settings you can change as well, but managing those settings is beyond the scope of this beginner’s guide.

Then, all you have to do is start your virtual machine, and the computer will begin booting inside a new window! From there, you can select a .iso file to install the operating system of your choice!

With your virtual machine set up, you can do all sorts of cool things with it, such as changing the window size, saving the machine state for an easy reload, and exporting/importing virtual machines for backup or duplication!

Note that for certain features to work such as USB passthrough, you will need to install the extension pack. Unlike the main software of VirtualBox, the extension pack is not open-source, which is why it is provided separately.

Some Virtual Machine Ideas

- Try new operating systems

Ever see an operating system you think looks really cool but aren’t sure whether you should make the full switch? Test out different operating systems through virtual machines that you can easily set up and just as easily delete when you no longer need them.

- Run Windows or macOS when needed

For users who primarily use Linux, if your studies or your work occasionally require you to use specific applications that are not available on your operating system, just boot into a different one!

- Test unknown software

If you are unsure how a program or configuration might impact your system, you should test it in a virtual machine first. This way, any potential damage whether done through malware or just a convoluted web of settings is restricted to the virtual environment and does not impact your primary set up.
