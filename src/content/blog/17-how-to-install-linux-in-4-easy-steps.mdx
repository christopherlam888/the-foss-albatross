How To Install Linux In 4 Easy Steps

So you’ve decided to give Linux a try! Congratulations!

However, what exactly do you need to do in order to get Linux set up instead of say Windows? Here’s a handy guide that explains each of 4 easy steps to install a Linux operating system on your computer!

1. Download

First, you need the installation file for the operating system of your choice! Similarly to how a desktop application on Windows requires a .exe file for installation, an operating system requires a .iso file.

A magnificent aspect of the FOSS nature of Linux operating systems is that .iso files are readily available for download, unlike with Windows and macOS that require purchase or special access. To download the .iso file you need, simply navigate to the web page of your Linux operating system of choice, then find and click on the download button or hyperlink!

2. Flash

After, you need to turn your .iso file into a bootable USB disk through which you can install the operating system! There are many tools available to flash .iso files to USB disks, but our favourite is the FOSS tool Balena Etcher. Etcher provides a beautiful and easy-to-follow graphical user interface to create a bootable USB disk. Simply install the application on your desktop, plug in your USB disk, and get flashing!

Note that you will need a blank USB disk to complete this step. I recommend a USB disk of minimum 8 GB in size since .iso files tend to require lots of space when flashed. You can also use other mediums such as DVDs, but the simplicity of flashing USB disks and then reformatting them afterwards for other uses makes them my recommendation for use.

3. Boot

Next, you need to actually boot to your bootable USB disk! You will need to enter the boot menu of your computer to select your bootable USB disk. Once you select the appropriate disk, your computer will load the installer for the Linux operating system of your choice!

This step can be tricky since the key you need to press to enter your boot menu differs among computer makes and models. Upon booting up your computer, the motherboard screen may list a selection of buttons you can press to enter various menus, including the BIOS and boot menu among others. If you do not know your boot menu key, do a quick Internet search for your computer. If your computer contains a combination of parts from different brands, search for your motherboard brand. Usually, the boot menu key is one of the function keys or Esc.

4. Install

Now, you can finally begin installing your operating system! Many Linux operating systems provide a graphical user interface that you can follow for ease of installation. All you need to do is read the prompts, click the appropriate buttons, and watch the progress bar fill up until you’re all set!

Upon installation, you can choose where to install your operating system. Take care to choose the appropriate disk so you don’t accidentally write over important data. Furthermore, you can also choose to perform an installation alongside another operating system, such as Windows. This way, you can have a dual boot setup, meaning you can choose which operating system to use upon every boot.

Enjoy!

Finally, you can revel in the magnificence of Linux! Many Linux operating systems include a welcome tour that guides you through key features and steps to get set up. From there, you can go on to explore the various apps you can use, settings you can change, and components you can customize! If you ever get stuck, you can always check the documentation or search forums of which there are many that specialize in specific operating systems.

Once you make the switch, you won’t want to go back!
