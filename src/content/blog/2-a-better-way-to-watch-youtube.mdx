A Better Way to Watch YouTube

YouTube is amazing! YouTube is the ultimate video sharing platform that brings amazing content by talented creators to viewers all around the world.

However, YouTube does come with its drawbacks, especially for viewers concerned about privacy and those seeking a better user experience. Fortunately, free and open-source alternatives exist for watching YouTube videos! In this article, you will learn about the incredible benefits of NewPipe and Invidious, two FOSS front-end clients for YouTube, and why you should consider making the switch!

To start, a main concern with YouTube is transparency regarding what is really going on behind those flashy videos and copious searches you make. The closed-source nature of YouTube code means that users are left wondering what and how much data Google is gathering. Through trackers, analytics, and potentially other routes in the YouTube API, Google can collect data on your usage, including your interests and watch time!

Although Google does have options to improve privacy through turning off search history and personalized ads, Google still retrieves data from your usage to further their research and development. If you are concerned with privacy and having freedom from data collection online, these FOSS front-end clients for YouTube are excellent options to continue enjoying your favourite videos!

An added benefit is that FOSS front-end clients have no ads! Since FOSS developers do not operate on a profit-motive, there is no need to include ads in the user interface or in videos, so you only see the media that you want to!

Additionally, alternative front-end clients provide many features that YouTube, or at least the free version, lacks. NewPipe and Invidious among other options may provide a cleaner and richer user experience for you depending on your tastes, so keep reading to learn more!

NewPipe

NewPipe is an Android app that serves as an alternative front-end client for YouTube.

NewPipe can be easily installed from F-Droid, although I recommend adding NewPipe’s own F-Droid repository to the repository list to receive the latest updated versions.

NewPipe’s user interface is simpler than that of the YouTube app, and yet it provides more features! The home screen shows trending videos. Swipe right and you can create channel groups and see your subscriptions – all without an account! Swipe right again and you can view your bookmarked playlists.

Through the menu, you can also check for new videos from your subscribed channels, see a list of videos you have downloaded (Yes, you can download YouTube videos straight through the app!), and review your history.

Searching for videos is intuitive, and you can select what type of YouTube content to search. However, NewPipe does not support other filters such as video quality and duration as well as sorting by upload date.

Each video includes comments, a series of related videos, and the description along with tags. Unfortunately, you cannot view streams of comments or interact with the video through commenting or liking.

The most outstanding feature of NewPipe is the availability of three playback options! You can watch the video as you would normally on the YouTube app within the user interface or in full screen. But, you can also watch the video as a size-adjustable popup as you perform other actions on your phone outside of the app. If you simply exit the app, turn off your screen, or press the appropriate button, you can play in background mode, which is especially useful for podcasts and music. The availability of all these features essentially provides the YouTube Premium experience for free!

Of course, you can also share the video through a link and open the video in a browser instead.

NewPipe also supports platforms other than YouTube, such as SoundCloud, media.ccc.de, FramaTube, and Bandcamp, but all those are still in beta.

The main downside of using NewPipe is that it is less stable than the YouTube app, which has greater support and constant development. Occasionally, NewPipe may break, so you will need to make sure you update to the latest version to keep the app working smoothly.

Invidious

Invidious provides a good front-end option for use outside of Android, namely in a web-based instance or within other apps.

Simply navigate to invidious.io and choose a public instance! Experienced tech enthusiasts can also host their own instances.

The homepage layout is clean and intuitive, with a tab for popular videos and another for trending videos, in addition to a donate button. You can set your preferences in the settings menu and also create an account to gain full access to features, such as subscribing to channels and creating playlists.

Searching for videos supports all the filters of the YouTube site!

Each video post shows all comments, related videos, and the description. Invidious even includes additional information about the video on the left side, such as dislikes. You can play the video just as you would on the YouTube site or play audio only. You can also easily switch Invidious instances or watch the video on YouTube instead.

A major shortcoming of Invidious is that it is web-based, although there are some options that allow you to use Indivious through an app. Also, registering an account is necessary to obtain some features.

Overall, NewPipe and Invidious are two FOSS options to consider if you are seeking a better way to watch YouTube. I use both these platforms to view YouTube videos on a regular basis, and I am extremely happy with the benefits they provide. I can confidently give my recommendation for you to try them out in place of the standard YouTube front-end!
