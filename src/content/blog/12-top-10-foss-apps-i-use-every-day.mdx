Top 10 FOSS Apps I Use Every Day

1. NewPipe

NewPipe is undoubtedly my favourite FOSS app! This amazing project allows users to watch YouTube without ads and tracking from Google while also providing a plethora of additional features. Through NewPipe, users can subscribe to channels and check for newest videos, play videos in popup and in the background, download videos for later, and so much more. This app truly is the better way to watch YouTube!

2. Signal

Signal is the best communication app out there right now! Protect your privacy in online texting with the Signal protocol for end-to-end encryption. Furthermore, Signal’s minimal metadata collection helps prevent tracking. Signal is reliable and as easy to use as any other instant messaging app out there. Get started now and join the move towards more private communication.

3. Browser: Mull, Brave

A browser is arguably the most important app on your phone since it is your gateway to the Internet. A browser that helps your productivity and respects your privacy is crucial to a good mobile experience. I actually have two browsers of choice (yes, this technically counts as two apps but let’s group them together!): Mull and Brave. Mull is a hardened Firefox-based browser I particularly enjoy for its lack of telemetry and add on support. Brave is privacy-focused Chromium-based browser that is great for its ad-blocking out-of-the-box and tracking protection.

4. Forecastie

Everyone needs a weather app to check conditions outside and plan ahead! Forecastie is a fantastic front-end displaying data from OpenWeatherMap, a well-developed global weather data provider. Forecastie provides more data than most weather applications going beyond just temperature and sky by including wind speed and direction, pressure, humidity, sunrise, sunset, UV index, and more. You can also view the weather on a map and on graphs over time.

5. Element

Element is another communication app that offers an experience with more features and a pretty cool open standard for messaging: matrix. Element is the most popular and actively-developed front-end client for matrix that provides a clean and intuitive user interface. Element is a great replacement for team chats such as Discord and Slack that protects your privacy with decentralized communication and end-to-end encryption among many other measures.

6. K-9 Mail

A FOSS email client is a great way to combine multiple email inboxes from different providers. Plus, you can also remove the need for potentially privacy invasive apps. My current email client of choice is K-9 mail, which has a very intuitive user interface and decent design. K-9 also has a few functions not included in many email apps.

7. Stocks Widget

Keep track of your portfolio with this great stocks app! I particularly enjoy this app for its cool-looking widgets that allow you to organize your stocks and display them on an automatically-updating board. This stocks app also includes colours for positive and negative change, regular stock updates, and a news aggregator that provides info on specific stocks and the market in general.

8. VLC

A media player allows you to enjoy music and videos you have locally rather than searching online. VLC is my player of choice given its reliability, support for many formats, variety of features, and community. The VLC app also includes sorting, favorites, playlists, and theming in addition to background playback.

9. News Provider

A news app is important to help keep up with current events. FOSS RSS feed aggregators are a great way to see the latest stories from your news sources of choice. With this easy-to-use news app, I can simply copy-and-paste links to feeds from my favourite sources, such as the Wall Street Journal and The Economist, click on interesting headlines, and then open the link to the full article in my browser of choice to read on.

10. Currency

For frequent travelers and any financially-minded individuals monitoring the foreign exchange market, a currency app is essential. Once again, there are many FOSS currency apps available. The one I use offers a nice and simple UI with data pulled from the European Central Bank.
