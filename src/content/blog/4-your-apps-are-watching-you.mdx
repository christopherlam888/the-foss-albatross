Your Apps Are Watching You

(generic eyes)

The apps on your phone may seem like harmless functions that help you be more productive; however, the truth about what these apps can do goes way beyond the facade of a simple logo and beautiful UI!

Every app has the potential to contain trackers that monitor your activity that may or may not be contained to just the app. Furthermore, some apps may have permissions to access data, like your storage and contacts, and functions, like your camera and microphone, that present potential privacy and security risks.

Fortunately, you can use Exodus to check what trackers and permissions are in each of your apps! Exodus is a FOSS project that generates privacy audit reports for Android apps. You can download their app from F-Droid to analyze all the apps installed on your phone! You can also search for specific apps on their website: https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/

The Big Tech Companies

The most often culprits for the implementation of trackers are big tech companies looking to gather as much data as possible.

Here is a list of big tech companies with a significant presence in Android apps:

- Google

- Amazon

- Facebook

- Huawei

- Microsoft

- Unity

These big tech companies can use the data they gather to support their profit motives in two main ways.

They’re Helping You

(Exodus Example)

On one hand, these big tech companies may simply seek to improve the apps they provide.

Analytics are an important method for developers to learn how people interact with their UI and also to understand what happens under the hood when features go wrong. Developers can then use this data to fix bugs and better the experience. For instance, even the Tor Browser, an app held in high-regard by the tech community for its privacy, contains Google Analytics.

Another point worth noting is that some trackers and also permissions may be important for an app’s functionality. Location may be important for an e-commerce app to approximate where you are so it can show available products, use your currency, and estimate shipping. Meanwhile, a calculator that has access to your camera and microphone may be stalkerware and thus pose a threat to your privacy and security.

As such, do not be overly concerned with the mere presence of trackers and permissions within an app. However, be careful if the number or nature of trackers and permissions seems excessive.

They’re Watching You

(Exodus Example)

On the other hand, big tech companies may seek to gather as much information about users as possible that they can then exploit through marketing strategies.

Profiling trackers create a digital profile about you as a user including what you search and what apps you use. Then, identification trackers determine your digital identity by correlating your online activities through personally identifiable information like names, pseudonyms, and email addresses.

Ad-related trackers can then be implemented to display targeted ads based on a user’s profile and identity. Ads are the most used method for developers from big tech and small organizations alike to monetize their work. Some common ad-related trackers include Google AdMob, Amazon Advertisement, and Facebook Ads.

In essence, big tech companies profit off your information, so they are incentivized to constantly harvest more. While big tech companies need these activities for their revenue, you may consider such tracking an invasion of privacy.

What Can You Do?

(Exodus Combined)

Check the Exodus App Frequently – By monitoring the trackers and permissions within each of your apps, you can evaluate whether the apps you have installed pose a significant threat to your privacy and security. Note that app trackers and permissions may change with each app update, so make sure you check Exodus frequently.

Keep Your Apps Updated – Many apps have permissions that could be dangerous if exploited for malicious purposes, such as access to your camera, microphone, and location. By keeping your apps updated, you can ensure that vulnerabilities in each app are minimized thanks to latest security patches.

Install As Few Apps As Possible – The best way to prevent trackers and permissions from threatening your privacy and security is by not granting them access in the first place. Uninstall apps you no longer use and disable unnecessary system apps. For apps you use regularly, you may want to revoke some permissions that seem excessive or that relate to functions you do not use.

Replace Apps With Privacy and Security Alternatives – There are many apps that are specifically designed to prioritize your privacy and security. Many of these apps are FOSS! The beauty of FOSS apps is that their code is publicly-available and so open to evaluation by the public. As such, FOSS apps generally only include the minimum trackers and permissions based on the app’s functionality. Plus, many FOSS apps are not developed based on a profit motive, so you will not need to deal with ads being embedded in the UI. Stay tuned to The FOSS Albatross to learn about a variety of FOSS alternatives to mainstream apps.
